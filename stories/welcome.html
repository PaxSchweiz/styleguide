  <p>This is a UI component styleguide for Pax (www.pax.ch).</p>

    We've added some basic stories inside the <code class="code">stories</code> directory.
    <br />
    A story is a single state of one or more UI components. You can have as many stories as you want.
    <br />
    (Basically a story is like a visual test case.)
